# 🎾 Cracking the Code of Champions: What the Data Reveals About Top 10 Tennis Players

This case study investigates what separates the ATP Top 10 players from lower-ranked players by analyzing Grand Slam match data from 2000–2022. Using SQL (BigQuery) and Excel, I explored serve performance metrics across different ranking tiers and surfaces.

### 🔍 Key Insights

- Top 50 players hit the most aces on average — more than the Top 10 — suggesting they rely on serve dominance to compete.
- The Top 10 are more efficient and precise, with the best ace-to-double-fault ratio.
- First and second serve win percentages show a clear ranking gradient: the higher the rank, the more consistently points are won.
- Grass courts yield the highest serve stats across all ranks, while clay reduces serve impact.

### 📊 Tools Used

- **BigQuery (SQL)**: Data cleaning, transformation, aggregation.
- **Excel**: Visualizations, pivot tables, formatting.
- **Kaggle ATP Dataset**: 180K+ matches from 1968–2022, filtered to Grand Slams post-2000.
