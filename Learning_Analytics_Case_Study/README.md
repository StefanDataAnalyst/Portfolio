# 📊 Learning Analytics in Dutch Vocational Education

This case study was developed while working on educational innovation in Dutch vocational education. It presents a method to connect learning design with learning analytics and early-warning indicators, aimed at improving student guidance and outcomes.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Learning Design → Analytics Mapping:** Translating course structure into measurable indicators.
- **Early Warning Indicators (EWI):** Using data to identify students at risk.
- **Dashboards for Teachers:** Clear, actionable insights based on course progression.
- **Theory to practice:** Bridges learning theory with technical dashboards.

## 🔍 Why This Matters

This project shows how even non-technical stakeholders (teachers, learning designers) can work with analytics  
when the **right framework and communication** is used. It also demonstrates my ability to:

- Translate abstract goals into measurable indicators
- Collaborate across tech and pedagogy
- Document methods clearly for reuse and scaling
