# 🐻 Best Baseball Mascots: SQL Analysis Case Study

This study explores the question:  
**Which baseball teams with which mascots perform best?**

Using a custom-built dataset and SQL in Google BigQuery, I cleaned, joined, and analyzed two tables:
- **Team Performance Data** (wins, runs, and standings)
- **Mascot Presence** (binary: yes/no)

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Google BigQuery (SQL)
- Spreadsheet editor for light formatting and PDF export

## 📊 Key Techniques
- Data cleaning: handling missing values, casing, and NULLs
- Filtering + conditional logic using `CASE`
- Aggregations: averages, totals, group-wise comparisons
- Joins between different data sources
- Creating team ranking logic

## 💡 Key Insights
- Mascot teams slightly outperformed non-mascot teams in average wins.
- However, statistical significance wasn’t tested (small sample size).
- The presence of a mascot may correlate with higher audience engagement — a direction worth exploring further.
